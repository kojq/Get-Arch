# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version will be supported with security updates until the repository is archived.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

A security vulnerability is a weakness that enables attackers to compromise confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Private vulnerability reporting is enabled for the repository.

If that is not possible to use, contact us through a community platform.

If your report is not private, only when prompted, state the class of vulnerability, the vulnerability, how to exploit the vulnerability, and where the vulnerability is located in the source code.
